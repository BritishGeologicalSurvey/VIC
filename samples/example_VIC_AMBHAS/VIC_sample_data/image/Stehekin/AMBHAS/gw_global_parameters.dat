---Comment below here---
0. groundwater parameter file name 
1. number of rows (lat) 
2. number of cols (rows) 
3. number of time steps output is written
4. lat grid spacing, if irregular set to 1
5. lon grid spacing, if irregular set to 1
6. time step (in days)
7. Output option for h field in out_data.nc 0: every time step, 1: last time step, int: every int time step 
8. SimulationMode 0: steady state, 1: transient with initial conditions from input,  3: dynamic steady state, 
9. Use restart file as initial conditions, 0: no, 1:yes. filename=h_ini.nc
10. read in 0: K [m/day] or 1: Trans [m2/day]
11. 1: confined or 0: unconfined aquifer
12: 0: regular grid using DLAT and DLON, 1: irregular grid reading in cell dimension and cell area for each cell
13: 0: no pumping time series is read in, 1: pumping time series is read in
14. 1 Sy has one value in the soil and one in the aquifer. Depth of the soil and Sy_soil are read in in the gw_data.nc file
15. Fraction of water of a soil layer that can recharge in one time step. Limits recharge to reduce instability.
