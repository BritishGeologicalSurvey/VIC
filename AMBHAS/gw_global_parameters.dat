1. number of rows (lat) 
2. number of cols (rows) 
3. number of time steps
4. lat grid spacing
5. lon grid spacing
6. time step (in days)
7. Output option for h field in out_data.nc 0: every time step, 1: last time step, int: every int time step 
8. SimulationMode 0: steady state, 1: transient with initial conditions from input, 2: transient and initial conditions from steady state, 3: dynamic steady state, 4: transient with dynamic steady state as initial conditions
9. Period for dynamic steady state. only used for simulation mode 3 and 4
10. Use restart file as initial conditions, 0: no, 1:yes. filename=h_init.nc
11. read in 0: K [m/day] or 1: Trans
12. 1: confined or 0: unconfined aquifer
